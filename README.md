# Safe and Scalable UAM Trajectory Planner  

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a novel concept in which partially or fully autonomous air vehicles transport passengers and cargo in dense urban environments. UAM operation is a multi-agent safety-critical application, where safety and scalability are the primary design considerations. Therefore, a UAM trajectory planning framework needs to generate trajectories efficiently while guaranteeing that the generated trajectories satisfy the systemâ€™s safety requirements. This project implements a multi-agent trajectory planner that enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to navigate to the assigned destinations while avoiding collision with other agents in the environment.

## Usage
An example setup of running an entire simulation is given in [UAMTrajectoryPlannerExample.mlx](https://insidelabs-git.mathworks.com/marto/safe-and-scalable-uam-trajectory-planner/-/tree/master) file. The implemented trajectory planner is equipped with two main modules: Reachability Analysis and Markov Decision Process (MDP) based decision-making framework. The following diagram explanins how the framework operates.
